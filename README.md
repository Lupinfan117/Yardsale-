# Identifying Customer segment
Our application makes it easy for users to buy what they want most. In other words, we analyze purchasing activity / purchasing psychology as user segment.
Yardsale constantly analyzes search words and information on items that users have seen in detail. By processing the images of the products, we realize the accuracy that has never existed.
For example, if some users are looking at red shirts or red shoes, Yardsale suggest a red tie. Also Yardsale will change the items Yardsale recommend according to users' residence. Do high school students living in Texas need a thick coat? The answer is no.
From ordinary purchase activities, we will organize these information and make it easy to find the products you always need.
By using this technology, we are able to target a large and diverse customer segement. Our customer segment is primarily middle class users who wish to either make a little extra money on the side by selling items that they don't need or are looking for a bargain.

# Products and Services
Our custromers are those of convienience so we design our products that way. The free version of our service takes a 3% cut on each sale by the user. Although a premium plan is avaible for constant users with a monthly reccurring fee. The free package is ideal for somone who doesn't make sales often and plans for long runnning sales. The monthly plan would be more suited for somone who makes sales on the daily. In the future we made add another option. Like a plan for longer periods of time than a month saving users even more money.
