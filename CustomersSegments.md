# Connecting to Customer Segments

We plan on connecting to customer segments through notifications on our app, which alll of our coustomers will already have. We would raise 
customer awareness by biving them notifications whem we seem similar things to what the have recently bought, posted on the app. Because our
buisness plan is based on us getting a portion of every sale, customers do not actually evaluate whether we have a good product to buy, but whether
other users who have posted a item have a good product. By doing this, we deliver value by putting a buyer and a seller in contact with each
other so that they can make a transaction. Yardsale has a dedicated support team to help users on both technical and other issues that they can contact 
though our app.
